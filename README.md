# NetLogo Props Extension

This extension allows you to read and write Java system properties from within NetLogo.

## Building

Use the NETLOGO environment variable to tell the Makefile which NetLogoLite.jar to compile against.  For example:

    NETLOGO=/Applications/NetLogo\\\ 5.0
    make

If compilation succeeds, `props.jar` will be created.
